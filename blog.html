                Assignment 1 Reflection:
            </h3>
            <p>
                This assignment was not too difficult due to my past experience with web development. Even though I have not coded using html and css for a long time, it was fun to get back to it and relearn and remember some of the things I have forgotten about like
                box shadows in css and the difference between padding and margin. For me the best resource for front end development is "w3schools.com".

                Assignment 2 Reflection:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Assignment 2 was a tedious task if I was being honest. For me atleast was a lot of trial and error trying to match spacing correctly. The fonts on the other hand was only limited to two fonts, so matching fonts went smoother. Though the given html font
                link did not import all the font weights so I could not match the weights perfectly because I cannot touch the html and just the css. The colors on the mock image seemed to use basic vscode color presets though it may slightly differ,
                so matching it visually was easy. Overall this experience was not my favorite, but it was not too hard in the end.

                Assignment 3 Reflection:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Assignment 3 was pretty easy for me because I have good experience with Javascript and backend development.

                Assignment 4 Reflection:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Assignment 4 was probably the easiest assignment so far and wasn't challenging, 
                but that does not mean I did not learn how to work with node js.
                I have worked with websockets and http server is somewhat used in websockets, but I have not only used
                http servers. So that was a new experience.
                The best rescource for me in general are programming forum pages like stack overflow. 
                One thing I had to google is reading files and determning file types the request wanted.
